In Nepal, there has been a significant increase in Reinforced Concrete (RC) structures, with about 70% considered non-engineered, meaning they were not designed or supervised by engineers. Nepal is highly seismically active, with large earthquakes occurring every 60-70 years. Many non-engineered buildings were constructed before the introduction of codal provisions, designed only for vertical loads without considering seismic forces. These buildings were often built based on contractors' experience or guidance from mid-level technicians and masons, without consulting design professionals.

NBC 205:1994, also known as the Mandatory Rules of Thumb (MRT), provided basic seismic design guidelines. NBC 205:2012 further improved these guidelines by enhancing beam-column sizes and reinforcement. However, since NBC 205:1994 lacked seismic design and ductile detailing provisions, NBC 105:1994 was introduced to address these aspects. Buildings constructed under these codes are considered pre-engineered, ensuring minimum seismic safety.

After the Gorkha earthquake, it was evident that buildings constructed according to MRT guidelines were still vulnerable to seismic loads. To address these deficiencies, NBC 105:2020 was introduced, improving upon the seismic design provisions of NBC 105:1994. The updated codes now ensure better seismic safety for all types of structures, from low-rise to high-rise buildings. Buildings made from this code are considered as Engineered buildings.
All the existing non-engineered and pre-engineered buildings are vulnerable as compared to engineered one and need to be retrofitted to increase the strength and performance capacity of buildings.
