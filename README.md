Overview
In recent decades, Nepal has seen a significant rise in Reinforced Concrete (RC) structures, with approximately 70% classified as non-engineered buildings. These buildings were neither designed nor supervised by engineers and were constructed based on contractors' experience or guidance from mid-level technicians and masons. Nepal, being located in a highly seismically active zone, faces large earthquakes every 60-70 years. The vulnerability of these non-engineered structures is a major concern, as they were designed solely for vertical loads, without considering lateral seismic forces.

Building Code Development
Nepal Building Code (NBC)
NBC 205:1994 (Mandatory Rules of Thumb - MRT): Introduced basic seismic design guidelines.
NBC 205:2012: Enhanced guidelines by improving beam-column sizes and reinforcement.
NBC 105:1994: Addressed seismic design and ductile detailing aspects.
NBC 105:2020: Improved seismic design provisions of NBC 105:1994, ensuring better seismic safety for all structures.
Buildings constructed under these codes are considered pre-engineered, ensuring minimum seismic safety. However, post-Gorkha earthquake assessments revealed that buildings constructed according to MRT guidelines remained vulnerable to seismic loads. Thus, there is a need for retrofitting existing non-engineered and pre-engineered buildings to enhance their strength and performance capacity.

Study Objectives
This study aims to assess the strength and capacity of a typical non-engineered RC building and to evaluate the effectiveness of various retrofitting interventions.

Methodology
Modeling: A 3-story portal frame consisting of beams and columns was modeled in OpenSees.
Analysis: Non-linear dynamic and static analysis was performed to assess the building's strength and capacity.
Retrofitting Interventions: Five different retrofitting interventions were applied to non-engineered and pre-engineered buildings.
Performance Comparison: The performance of the retrofitted buildings was compared using pushover curves and fragility curves.
Retrofitting Interventions
The study evaluates five retrofitting interventions to enhance the seismic performance of non-engineered and pre-engineered buildings. The effectiveness of each intervention is analyzed and compared to ensure the most efficient methods are identified.

Results and Discussion
The comparative analysis using pushover and fragility curves demonstrates the improved performance of retrofitted buildings. The findings underscore the importance of adhering to updated building codes and implementing retrofitting measures to mitigate seismic risks.

Conclusion
The study highlights the critical need to retrofit existing non-engineered and pre-engineered buildings in Nepal to ensure their seismic safety. By adopting the updated NBC codes and applying effective retrofitting interventions, the resilience of RC structures against seismic events can be significantly enhanced.
